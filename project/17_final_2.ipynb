However, a common theme emerges that people tend to get used to the discomfort over time. The pain is often associated with tightness, difficulty eating, and potential challenges in speaking initially. Some mention the use of wax to alleviate pain caused by friction with brackets. Despite the initial challenges, many report adapting quickly and experiencing less discomfort as time goes on. The experiences also highlight that age, the specific treatment plan, and the severity of the dental issues can influence the level of discomfort.
