The formula for MCHC is Hemoglobin x 100 divided by Hematocrit. This test is particularly useful in evaluating therapy for anemia, using Hemoglobin and Hematocrit in the calculation instead of R.B.C. A low MCHC indicates that a unit of packed R.B.C.'s contains less hemoglobin than normal, while a high MCHC suggests more hemoglobin in a unit of R.B.C.'s. Increased MCHC is observed in conditions like spherocytosis but not in pernicious anemia. Decreased levels may indicate iron deficiency, blood loss, B6 deficiency, or thalassemia. The normal adult range for MCHC is 32-36%, with an optimal reading of 34%. Higher ranges are found in newborns and infants. MCHC is an essential parameter in assessing and managing anemia.\n",

However, a common theme emerges that people tend to get used to the discomfort over time. The pain is often associated with tightness, difficulty eating, and potential challenges in speaking initially. Some mention the use of wax to alleviate pain caused by friction with brackets. Despite the initial challenges, many report adapting quickly and experiencing less discomfort as time goes on. The experiences also highlight that age, the specific treatment plan, and the severity of the dental issues can influence the level of discomfort. Ultimately, several individuals express that the pain diminishes over time, and they become accustomed to having braces.\n",

      "Answers: [\"Many children are born with JAUNDICE.  When the baby was in the womb, the mother's liver took care of the excess pigment (called bilirubin) in the blood that causes jaundice. It takes a while for the baby's liver to be able to process and eliminate it. \\n\\nMild cases can be treated by exposing baby briefly to sunlight and making sure baby is getting plenty of fluids (breastmilk is best).  More severe cases can be treated by your pediatrician using special light therapy.\", 'What is jaundice? \\nJaundice is an illness that can happen in the first few days of a baby\\'s life. It turns your baby\\'s skin, eyes and mouth a yellow color. The yellow color is caused by bilirubin.\\n\\nBilirubin is made when the body breaks down old red blood cells. This is a normal process that happens all through life. Bilirubin goes to the liver, where it is changed again. Then it goes into the intestines and the kidneys, and then it goes out of the body. If too much bilirubin builds up in your baby\\'s body, it makes a yellow color called jaundice (say: \"john-diss\").\\n\\nJaundice is common in babies and is usually not serious.\\n\\nWhy do some babies get jaundice? \\nRed blood cells have a shorter life in babies than they do in adults. This means more bilirubin goes through your baby\\'s liver. If your baby\\'s skin is bruised during birth, more red cells may need to be broken down. Then your baby\\'s liver has to handle even more bilirubin. Sometimes a baby\\'s liver is not mature enough to handle the extra bilirubin.\\n\\n\\nHow can I tell if my baby has jaundice? \\nYou should watch for color changes in your baby\\'s skin. You should also check the whites of your baby\\'s eyes and the pink skin inside your baby\\'s mouth. If they get yellowish, you may want to see your baby\\'s doctor. If your baby has pale skin, it should look white when you gently press it with your fingertips. If the skin looks yellow, your baby may have jaundice. If your baby has darker skin, it may be harder to check, except by looking at your baby\\'s eyes and inside your baby\\'s mouth.\\n\\nArtificial light, especially fluorescent lights, can sometimes fool your eyes into seeing a yellow color that is not really there. So you might want to check your baby in daylight in a sunny room.\\n\\nAs the amount of bilirubin in the blood increases, your baby\\'s body will get more yellow. As the bilirubin level rises, the yellow color can move from your baby\\'s head down to the chest and even down to the toes.\\n\\nIf your baby\\'s skin is yellow, see your baby\\'s doctor right away. The doctor will take a small amount of your baby\\'s blood and measure the bilirubin in it.\\n\\n\\nHow is jaundice treated? \\nIf the bilirubin level is not too high, your baby might not need any treatment. Your doctor might just want you to feed your baby breast milk or formula more often.\\n\\nIf the bilirubin level is very high or is getting higher very quickly, your baby will need light therapy. This is also called phototherapy. Phototherapy helps to break down bilirubin in your baby\\'s skin.\\n\\nFor this treatment, your baby is placed under special white, blue or green lights. The baby might also be placed on a special light-producing blanket. Your baby\\'s eyes are covered to protect them from the bright lights. Phototherapy usually lasts for 1 or 2 days.\\n\\nPhototherapy can give your baby loose stools, temperature problems or dehydration. Your doctor will watch your baby carefully to prevent or treat these problems.\\n\\nIf your baby\\'s bilirubin level gets too high, and phototherapy does not work well enough, the baby might need an exchange transfusion. In this treatment, some of your baby\\'s blood is taken out, and it is replaced with blood from someone else.\\n\\n\\nCan jaundice hurt my baby? \\nJaundice is not a serious problem in most healthy babies. However, very high bilirubin levels can be dangerous. It can give some babies brain damage.\\n\\nYour doctor will measure your baby\\'s bilirubin level a number of times. If necessary, your baby will be treated. This usually keeps the bilirubin level from getting high enough to hurt your baby.\\n\\n \\n\\nHow long will my baby have jaundice? \\nJaundice lasts for a different time in different babies. Often, the bilirubin level goes up for the first 3 to 4 days and then slowly goes back down. A baby who is breastfed may have mild jaundice for a longer time than a baby who is formula-fed.']\n",
      "Summaries:\n",
      "  INFORMATION_SUMMARY: Jaundice is a common condition in newborns, occurring in the first few days of life, causing the skin, eyes, and mouth to turn yellow due to excess bilirubin. Bilirubin is produced when the body breaks down old red blood cells, and its accumulation leads to jaundice. While mild cases can be treated with sunlight exposure and adequate fluid intake, more severe cases may require special light therapy under a pediatrician's guidance. Jaundice is usually not serious, but very high bilirubin levels can be dangerous, potentially causing brain damage. Monitoring bilirubin levels and appropriate treatment help prevent complications. The duration of jaundice varies among babies, with breastfed infants possibly experiencing it for a longer time compared to formula-fed babies. Regular monitoring by a healthcare provider ensures timely intervention if needed.\n",
      "  SUGGESTION_SUMMARY: For jaundice, it's advised to observe color changes in your baby's skin, whites of the eyes, and the pink skin inside the mouth. If these areas appear yellowish, it's recommended to consult your baby's doctor. Checking your baby in daylight, especially in a sunny room, can be helpful in assessing jaundice symptoms.\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
